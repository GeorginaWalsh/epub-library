***Aim***

A site that lets you:
-upload epubs
-read epubs
-highlight text
-make comments

Creating a website where you can upload, host, and read EPUB files on any device is a multifaceted project. You’d need to consider both front-end and back-end development. Here’s how different languages can be suitable:

**Front-End Development**  
To design the interface of the website, you’ll need:
- **HTML** and **CSS**: For the structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript**: To handle interactive elements and ensure cross-device compatibility.

You might also consider using front-end frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js** to streamline development for complex interfaces.

**Back-End Development**  
For uploading files, storing them on the server, and managing file metadata, use:
- **Python**: Its frameworks like Django or Flask are great for building robust back-end systems. You can also use Python libraries to work with EPUB files (e.g., `ebooklib`).
- **Node.js (JavaScript)**: If you prefer a JavaScript-based back-end, Node.js can handle file uploads and server-side tasks.
- **PHP**: Popular for handling file uploads and server-side logic.

**Database Management**  
To store file information and user data, you’ll need a database:
- **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** (SQL databases)
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL)

**File Handling and EPUB Rendering**  
To enable reading of EPUB files directly from the site:
- Use **JavaScript libraries** like EPUB.js, which can render EPUB content in the browser.
- Python libraries can preprocess EPUB files if needed.

**Hosting and Deployment**  
For deployment on GitHub Pages, note that GitHub Pages is designed for hosting static websites. You might need external hosting (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure) for dynamic back-end functionality.

Overall, combining **JavaScript (for front-end and EPUB rendering)** and **Python (for back-end)** can be a practical approach. If you'd like guidance on any specific feature or step, I'd be happy to help you brainstorm!
